[GeneX Project | Omnichain NFT](https://linktr.ee/genexprojectnft)  

This repo is website of the GeneX Project. 

What is GeneX Project?
The GeneX Project is a unique and rare 3D omnichain NFT collection of 5555 NFTs generated by random generation of over 200 features. The collection offers the opportunity to easily switch between networks such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Arbitrum that host Layer Zero technology.
GeneXs represent a journey to planet Proxima B, with conditions very similar to our world, against inequality, injustice, racism, gender abuse and much more negative emotions in the world. Become part of the colony to this planet by owning GeneX.

GeneX Project NFT, which I am the founder of, is a free mint NFT collection. The Mint process was successful. In secondary markets (tofuNFT, Quixotic, OpenSea etc) it has realized a volume of 10K-20K dollars. 

I developed most of the technical parts such as the website and smart contract. I used React.js, Next.js, Three.js and React Three for the website, while I used Hardhat, Solidity and Javascript for the smart contract.
